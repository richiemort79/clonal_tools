# clonal_tools
ImageJ toolset for the anlysis of clonal patterns

ClonalTools are a set of macros designed for the analysis of mosaic patterns. The macros correct for the effects of random
clumping using the formula 1/(1-p) devised by Roach (1968) in the way outlined by West (1975, 1976) and West et al (1997).
